Challenge 2 Hot N Cold

1st we would need the temperature in Celsius that we want to convert

5th subtract 32 to the quantity that you want to turn from Celsius to Fahrenheit, if we are talking about the same quantity it would be 68 - 32.
6th divide the result of the previous step by 1.8
7th The result is the temperature back in Fahrenheit

For example: I was born on October 20, 1999, and the current date is March 2023, if we subtract 2023 - 1999 = 24, since my the birthday of the person has not arrived yet, the user has 23 years.
