Challenge 2 Hot N Cold

1st we would need the temperature in Celsius that we want to convert
2nd We need to multiply the celsius value by 1.8
3rd add 32 to the previous result
4th the result obtained is the quantity of the temperature in Fahrenheit
5th subtract 32 to the quantity that you want to turn from Celsius to Fahrenheit, if we are talking about the same quantity it would be 68 - 32.
6th divide the result of the previous step by 1.8
7th The result is the temperature back in Fahrenheit

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Challenge 3 Geometry

Pyramid:
1st determine the base area of the pyramid 

2nd to determine the base area of the pyramid we would need to multiply length by width
3rd determine the height of the pyramid
4th multiply the base area by the height and divide the result by 3
5th the volume is the result of the last step

Cube: 
1st determine the length of one side of the cube
2nd Multiply the length by itself 3 times
3rd the result of the previous step is the area of the cube

Sphere:
1st we need to know the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the surface, which is the radius
2nd get the value of pi for the next steps
3rd multiply the radius by itself 3 times
4th multiply the result of the previous step by 4/3 and pi (3.1416)
5th the result is the volume of the sphere

1st Select the number
2nd check if the number can be divided by 2
3rd if the number can be divided by 2: the number is even, if the number can't be divided by 2: the number is odd
4th End
                                                                               
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
Challenge 2 How old are you

1st Select the user
2nd Ask them when they where born
3rd Subtract the current year with the user's birth date
4th Take in count that the age can vary depending on the birth month
5th If the current month and date is not the user's birthday, you have to subtract 1 to the result
For example: I was born on October 20, 1999, and the current date is March 2023, if we subtract 2023 - 1999 = 24, since my the birthday of the person has not arrived yet, the user has 23 years.

Challenge 3 Treasures
The tresure is on the chest A and C, the message shows that at least one has the tresure, which can means that 2 can have the treasure. Since all messages are lies, the chest B does not has the treasure because the chest A shows the message: the middle chest has the treasure. The chest B shows the message that all of these chests have treasure, which is a lie, it means that at least 1 can have the treasure. Finally the chest C message shows: Only one of these chests has treasure, which is also a lie, thats why there are 2 chests with treasures and the only one that is discarded directly is the B due to the message from chest A.

Challenge 1
Monday: Logic problem

5 students, the teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. 

If Alice would be saying the truth, it would be contradictory because Alice is saying that nobody sturied. Bob states that 1 person studied, this would be the only possible and logical solution, because no other person could be telling the truth due to the fact that there cannot be more than 1 statement at the same time being true.

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
